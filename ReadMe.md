# User Directory

## User Story
* This app allows a user to look at various aspects of their employees
* The Main Page allows users to click the button if they would like to see their employees or a specific employee
* The Navbar user react-router-dom to change pages

## Process
* I created a React App that can render multiple pages
* I used components as functions to render grids on the website
* I used various components to render onto pages
* I passed down props from one component to another

## Issues
* I would like to make it more a dynamic app by using backend routing
* I would like to try passing down more props and using state to change specific aspects of the page

## Demo
![Employee App]()
